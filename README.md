# Structured Error Handling and Pickling
**Dev:** *Bhawna*  
**Date:** *11.30.2021*

## Introduction
This assignment is about understanding and experimenting on how to handle errors/exceptions in python code. As part of this exercise, I will walk you through one example code where I will be creating student dictionary having keys as student name and the course in which they have enrolled themselves. Within the same example, I have introduced pickling which explains how the data can be stored in binary format in python. That being said, in the upcoming sections, I will show you how I have created different classes to performed different operations and the expected exceptions that can happen while performing operations on the list of student dictionaries.
